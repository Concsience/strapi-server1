## ðŸ“Š Risk Assessment

### **ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk Items**
- TypeScript compilation and type safety
- Business logic preservation (no breaking changes)
- Database query optimization
- Error handling improvements

### **ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk Items**
- Payment processing integration (thoroughly tested)
- Email notification system (depends on external services)
- File upload functionality (uses existing OVH S3 setup)

### **ðŸ”´ Monitor Closely**
- First customer transactions after deployment
- Stripe webhook processing under load
- Database performance with new TypeScript queries
- Memory usage with TypeScript runtime

## ðŸ”§ Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous git commit with JavaScript files
2. **Database**: Restore from pre-deployment backup if needed
3. **DNS**: Switch traffic back to previous version
4. **Monitor**: Verify rollback resolves issues
5. **Investigate**: Analyze logs to identify root cause
