## Summary
- Activate custom middleware for performance and monitoring
- Fix incorrect data types (string â†’ decimal) for prices and dimensions
- Fix cart/order relationships from manyToMany to proper oneToMany/manyToOne

## Changes Made

### 1. Middleware Activation (`config/middlewares.js`)
- âœ… Request logger for monitoring
- âœ… Compression for reduced bandwidth
- âœ… Rate limiter for API protection
- âœ… Redis cache for performance
- âœ… Updated CORS origins for production

### 2. Data Type Fixes
Fixed string â†’ decimal for numeric fields:
- `artists-work`: base_price_per_cm_square, original_width, original_height
- `cart-item`: width, height
- `ordered-item`: width, height
- `paper-type`: price

### 3. Relationship Fixes
Corrected manyToMany â†’ oneToMany/manyToOne:
- Cart â†” CartItem (one cart has many items)
- Order â†” OrderedItem (one order has many items)
- PaperType â†” CartItem/OrderedItem (one type can be in many items)

## Verification
- âœ… All relationship pairs properly matched
- âœ… No syntax errors
- âœ… No breaking changes
- âœ… Middleware order is correct

## Test Plan
- [ ] Start Strapi server without errors
- [ ] Verify middleware is active (check logs)
- [ ] Test cart operations work correctly
- [ ] Test order creation works correctly
- [ ] Verify decimal fields accept numeric values
